Quantitative Measurements:
• Compute and display lesion metrics such as area, volume (if 3D data is available), and shape features (e.g., perimeter, compactness).
• This can help clinicians track changes over time.

Confidence Scores & Uncertainty Estimates:
• Display additional model confidence metrics (e.g., probability distributions, heatmaps) so doctors can gauge the reliability of predictions.
• Consider using methods like Monte Carlo dropout to estimate uncertainty.

Manual Correction/Annotation Tools:
• Allow users to manually edit or refine the segmentation overlay using drawing or annotation tools.
• This creates a semi-automated workflow where the model provides an initial estimate that can be corrected.

Report Generation:
• Automatically generate a report that includes the original scan, segmentation outline, quantitative metrics, and confidence scores.
• The report could be downloadable as a PDF or integrated into hospital records.

Multi-Slice/3D Visualization:
• If you have volumetric data, provide a way to scroll through slices or visualize the segmentation in 3D.
• This adds context for complex lesions that span multiple slices.

User Feedback & Audit Trail:
• Incorporate a mechanism for clinicians to provide feedback on the segmentation accuracy, which can help refine the model over time.
• An audit trail or log of adjustments could improve traceability.

Integration with Existing Clinical Workflows:
• Consider how the app might integrate with existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) or PACS systems.
• For example, allow export of results in standardized formats (like DICOM-SEG or HL7).
